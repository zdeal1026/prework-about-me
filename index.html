      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello!! I am excited to start this adventure with everyone!! My name is Zach and for the last ten years I have been working in a radiology department in a local hospital. I have worked in x-ray, CT, OR, cath labs, and vascular labs. I have enjoyed it but I think it't time for a change. I have decided to take the risk and try to become a full stack web developer. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Hickory <bold>North Carolina</bold></p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am currently restoring a 1942 <italics>FORD</italics>GPW. I also like to play guitar and just hang out with my family. I have recently started to teach my children about vintage video games and that has been a blast!!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The dream job is to not have a job!! Unfortunately we all have to work but I would like to be able to build software for medical imaging companies like Siemens or GE!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>still hanging around in Hickory!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After the outbreak of COVID I have realized that my current field isn't as safe as I'd like it to be. I have been looking for a way to get out of healthcare for some time now and I have put alot of thought in to wWhat I would like to do. I used to create HTML pages in high school and I thought I would give it a shot!! </p>
